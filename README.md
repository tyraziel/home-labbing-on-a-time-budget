# Home Labbing on a Time Budget

## Description

Building a home lab is often seen as a financial challenge, but another constraint for many enthusiasts isn’t money, it’s time.

In this talk, we’ll explore how to stand up and maintain a functional home lab while working within a strict time budget. We'll focus on core services like DNS, Certificate Management, Identity and Access Management (IDAM) and automation to streamline setup and maintenance. By leveraging simple, effective solutions, without relying on cloud-based alternatives, you’ll learn how to get the most out of your lab without it becoming a second job, or disrupting the rest of your home network.

Whether you're an IT professional, a student, or a hobbyist, this session will provide practical strategies to help you optimize your time while still building a powerful and useful home lab.
